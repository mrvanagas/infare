This is a scraper built with axios and cheerio and Javascript. 

In its current configuration, it is meant to scrape fly540.com airlines for departing airports, flight dates, flight times and flight prices. Currently, it outputs data in a JSON format, until I figure out on how to export them into CSV format.
